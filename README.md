# KaliVM-Setup
My files and scripts for setting up my KaliVM how I like it.

## Steps
1. Download the 3 files
2. Make the follwing files executable with `chmod +x` | `githubdownload.py` , `kali-additions.sh`, and `install-homebrew.sh`
3. Execute `sudo -l` to be in sudo privilege level
4. Run `./kali-additions.sh`

TO DO: Add on mounts and include fonts?
