First - execute this from your home folder:

`git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm`

Second - copy the content above into your own `~/.tmux.conf` file

Third - To initialise, be sure you have entered into tmux (tmux enter at the command prompt) then hit `CTRL + B` then `SHIFT + I` to load.

Now your controls will be CTRL + A and so on.
